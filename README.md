## üéØ Papert Title
Risk Identification and Analysis in Software Development in Bangladesh IT Industry: A Hybrid Model

## üìù Description 
This paper is my BSc Academic thesis paper which published in AIUB Journal of Science and Engineering (AJSE).
The goal of this paper was the reduction of software risk in the Bangladesh IT Industry. The model has been conducted the goal through two teams i) DVC (Dynamic Verifier Core) and ii) NUT train-upteam. The DVC demonstrates the four risk phases and suggests decisions. The NUT train-up team facilitates the new technology which is ignored in the other models. Investigated the most risk impact areas of software project by doing a survey on 174 Bangladeshi IT Industries, and proposed a Hybrid Model for Mitigating Risks.
