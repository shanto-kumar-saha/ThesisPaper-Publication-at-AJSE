## 🚀 Paper Title
### Risk Identification and Analysis in Software Development in Bangladesh IT Industry: A Hybrid Model

## 📝 Description 
This paper is my BSc Academic thesis paper which published at AIUB Journal of Science and Engineering (AJSE).
The goal of this paper was the reduction of software risk in the Bangladesh IT Industry. The model has been conducted the goal through two teams i) DVC (Dynamic Verifier Core) and ii) NUT train-upteam. The DVC demonstrates the four risk phases and suggests decisions. The NUT train-up team facilitates the new technology which is ignored in the other models.
